make clean all
```

On macOS where the built-in Preview.app does not support auto-update, an alternative PDF reader [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io) is recommended.

In `~/.latexmk`
```sh
$pdf_previewer = 'open -a Skim';
```
to specify the PDF reader for latexmk.

### Clean intermediate files

```sh
make purge
```

### Clean all generated files

```sh
make clean
```
